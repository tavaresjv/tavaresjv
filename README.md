# Hi there! 🙋‍♂️
![capa_linkedin](images/foto_de_capa_linkedin.jpeg)
👨‍💻 Glad to meet you! I'm **José Vinícius Tavares**, a 24-year-old **Data Science Analyst** from São Paulo, Brazil. I hold a degree in **Chemical Engineering** from the **University of São Paulo (USP)** and currently work as a **Data Science Analyst** at **Itaú Unibanco**, where I focus on **generative AI model governance**, **real-time dashboards** **strategic data analysis**, and **translating business needs into data-driven solutions**.  

My passion lies in **Generative AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Storytelling**, and I'm constantly exploring ways to bridge the gap between technical models and business impact. I recently earned a **Bronze Medal 🥉** at the **27th Itaú Data Battle**, a testament to my analytical and collaborative skills.  

My passion lies in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Storytelling**. I'm constantly exploring ways to bridge the gap between technical models and business impact, ensuring AI projects are measurable, aligned with stakeholders, and deliver value. My **Bronze Medal 🥉** at the **27th Itaú Data Battle** reflects my problem-solving skills and collaborative approach.
